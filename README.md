# pk-rental
 Rental script for QBCore

 # Dependencies

**[QBCore Framework](https://github.com/qbcore-framework)** & **[qb-menu](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/qb-menu)**

# How To
 To add new vehicles to the rental menu follow the template in the config.lua
 
 If you are wanting to change spawn coords it is in the client.lua at the end of the QBCore Spawn Vehicle Function it is in vector3 form and the heading is above it called SetEntityHeading.

# Future Plans
 Config for coords

 Other menus for other locations like cars not just bikes

 Way to return possibly without being able to abuse it/duplicate money
